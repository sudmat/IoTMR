This review is organized in this manner: in the following of this chapter, I will try to highlight some crucial concepts involved in interface-based design, they might be important to illustrate my own understanding and position in this topic. Then in chapter 2, I will give a summary over interface theory, which is the fundamental of formal interface models and offers a theoretical base for talking about composition of interfaces. In chapter 3 and chapter 4
